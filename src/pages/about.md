Software developer from Bangalore, India. I write about web development, programming, and tech. Currently, I'm working at FORD PRO, where I've been focusing on improving system reliability and efficiency. My past work includes developing apps that help Indian farmers access vital market price information. I've also enjoyed mentoring young developers and leading teams to ensure projects run smoothly. With a background in computer science from Rajarajeswari College of Engineering, I'm dedicated to using technology to solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences. Connect with me on LinkedIn or check out my projects on GitHub to learn more about what I do.
