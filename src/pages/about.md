I’m Akash Raju M, a passionate software developer hailing from the vibrant city of Bangalore, India. My journey in the tech world has been an exciting adventure, filled with learning, challenges, and meaningful projects. I’m currently a part of the innovative team at Ford Pro, where we’re making strides in simplifying electric fleet charging for businesses.

Previously, I contributed to Gramhal, a non-profit organization dedicated to bridging the data divide for farmers by making crop prices more accessible. Before that, I was at Classcard, a startup that empowers small businesses to bring their classes online. Each experience has been a stepping stone, shaping my approach to software development and problem-solving.

Outside of work, I’m a tech enthusiast who loves exploring new tools and technologies. My interests also extend to traveling on my motorcycle. I believe in continuous learning and am always on the lookout for the next big thing to dive into.

Don't shy away from saying "Hi" to me via email or connect with me on social media. Let’s grow and learn together!
